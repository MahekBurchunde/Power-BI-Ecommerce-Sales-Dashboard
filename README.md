- Monitor sales performance across different regions in India.
- Identify top-selling products, categories, and customer segments.
- Analyze sales trends and seasonality patterns to optimize inventory management.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of marketing campaigns and promotional activities.
- Forecast future sales and set strategic targets to drive business growth.
